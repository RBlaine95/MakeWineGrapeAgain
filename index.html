<p>This is the third year project of Team Se7en from CTI Durbanville.</p>

<p>Make Wine Grape Again is coded completely in Java.</p>

<p>The Back-End developers are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Robert Blaine (<a href="https://github.com/RBlaine95" class="user-mention">@RBlaine95</a>)</li>
<li>Matthew Russell (<a href="https://github.com/dread5467" class="user-mention">@dread5467</a>)</li>

<p>Rocco de Villiers from <a href="http://www.capecrush.co.za">Cape Crush</a> contacted us to develop a system for him to use for his Wine Cellar. Matthew and Robert met with him as representatives of Team Se7en to discuss his ideas for the system.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/t94Piny.png" alt="Make Wine Grape Again"></p>

<p>During the meeting he mentioned that he would allow us to have all licensing and ownership rights for the stem, so we decided to make the system Open Source for easy future development for any developers interested in it. We also decided to make the program Free so that wine cellars that cannot afford expensive management systems may have the option of using our system for no charge.</p>
