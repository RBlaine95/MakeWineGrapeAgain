It is still in development._**\r\n\r\n### Welcome to Make Wine Grape Again.\r\nThis is the third year project of Team Se7en from CTI Durbanville.\r\n\r\nMake Wine Grape Again is coded completely in Java.\r\n\r\nThe Back-End developers are:\r\n* Robert Blaine (@RBlaine95)\r\n* Matthew Russell (@dread5467)\r\n\r\nThe Front-End developers are:\r\n* Earl van de Rhede (@mrchocolatezzz)\r\n* Darren Wildschut (@darrenmuffin23)\r\n\r\n### What is Make Wine Grape Again (MWGA)?\r\nRocco de Villiers from [Cape Crush](www.capecrush.co.za) contacted us to develop a system for him to use for his Wine Cellar. Matthew and Robert met with him as representatives of Team Se7en to discuss his ideas for the system.\r\n\r\nDuring the meeting he mentioned that he would allow us to have all licensing and ownership rights for the stem, so we decided to make the system Open Source for easy future development for any developers interested in it. We also decided to make the program Free so that wine cellars that cannot afford expensive management systems may have the option of using our system for no charge.\r\n\r\n### Features include:\r\n* Blending up to 10 wines together\r\n* Balling and Temperature graph\r\n* Saving Balling and Temperature graph as an image file\r\n* Tracking what chemicals were added to what batch\r\n* Cost calculator\r\n* Creating sub-batches of batches\r\n* Keeping record of grape origins and suppliers\r\n* Keeping record of who withdrew how many bottles of which wine and when\r\n* Database Backup and Restore **_COMING SOON_**\r\n* Free\r\n* Open Source\r\n* Scalable",
