### NOTE FROM DEVELOPERS
Make Wine Grape Again is still in Beta testing.  
We are actively making changes to the system.  

_**We will be temporarily halting releases for MWGA due to the fact that if we modify the Database Structure (e.g.: Add a field to a table) it renders old versions of the database unusable and updating the database would mean wiping your old database.**_

### What is Make Wine Grape Again (MWGA)?
Rocco de Villiers from [Cape Crush](http://www.capecrush.co.za) contacted us to develop a system for him to use for his Wine Cellar. Matthew and Robert met with him as representatives of Team Se7en to discuss his ideas for the system.

During the meeting he mentioned that he would allow us to have all licensing and ownership rights for the system, so we decided to make the system Open Source for easy future development for any developers interested in it.  
We have also decided to design the system free to wine cellars that have a minimal budget for management systems so that they may have the opportunity of using our system at no charge.

### JRebel Install
To use the new JRebel Dev function:
* Go to [MyJRebel](https://my.jrebel.com) and sign up for a Social Account (It's free, just link your FB/Twitter to JRebel)
* Install JRebel on Netbeans or IntelliJ IDEA and activate it with your activation code given to you by JRebel

JRebel will let you do live updates to the program while it's running. This means that if you find a bug, you can edit the code and it'll update, rather than having to close the program, edit the code, recompile/rebuild, retest, etc.
