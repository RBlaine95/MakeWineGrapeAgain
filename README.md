# How to Install Github
=====================
1) Run "GitHubSetup.exe" and wait for it to download and install.
2) While you wait, go to www.github.com and create an account if you haven't already.
3) Also, go to https://github.com/RBlaine95/Project-Se7en and become a collaborator
4) Once GitHub has installed, DO THE TUTORIAL!!!!
			!!!!!!!!AND READ IT!!!!!!!
5) Once you've DONE THE TUTORIAL, create a clone of Project-Se7en (there's a button on the website)
6) OPEN YOUR OWN BRANCH FOR PROJECT-SE7EN IN CASE YOU FUCK UP SOMETHING, IT WON'T BREAK THE MASTER BRANCH
7) Name your branch "Your-Name-Se7en" (for example: "Robbie-Se7en", or "Earl-Se7en", or "Matthew-Se7en", or "Darren-Se7en", need I continue?)
8) For more information go to https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
9) YouTube and Google are your friends. Always.
=====================

Actually, go to https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ any ways and read. It. Will. Help.

=====================
With regard to libraries and APIs
=====================
APIs and Libraries will be located in the APIs and Libraries Folders AS WELL AS inside the actual program so that we don't need to re-direct Netbeans to the APIs and Libraries the whole fucking time.
